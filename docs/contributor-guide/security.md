## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Mermin seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by opening a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/elastiflow/mermin/security/advisories/new).

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., privilege escalation, information disclosure, eBPF verifier bypass, denial of service, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 5 business days.
- We will send a more detailed response within 10 business days indicating the next steps in handling your report.
- We will keep you informed about the progress toward a fix and full announcement.
- We may ask for additional information or guidance.

### Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated disclosure:

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly.
- We request that you give us a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability before public disclosure.
- Once the vulnerability is patched, we will publish a security advisory on GitHub.
- We will credit you in the advisory unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

Thank you for helping keep Mermin and the community safe!
