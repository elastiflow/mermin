# Grafana Stack End-to-End Test

## Overview

This directory contains an end-to-end (E2E) test environment designed to validate the entire `mermin` data pipeline. It ensures that flow spans generated by the **mermin** eBPF agent can be successfully captured, forwarded by the **OpenTelemetry Collector**, ingested by **Grafana Tempo**, and ultimately visualized in **Grafana**.

This test provides a reliable way to confirm that the core functionality—from capture to storage and visualization—is fully operational.

## Components

This test environment consists of two main parts:

1. **Observability Backend (Docker Compose):** A `docker-compose.yaml` file orchestrates the backend services:
    * **Grafana:** For visualization.
    * **Grafana Tempo:** For trace storage.
    * **OpenTelemetry Collector:** To receive data from `mermin` and export it to Tempo.
    * **Prometheus:** For metrics.
    * **Traffic Generator:** A simple container that creates network traffic for `mermin` to observe.
2. **Mermin Deployment (Kubernetes):** A local `kind` cluster is used to deploy the `mermin` agent via its Helm chart.

## Prerequisites

Before running the test, ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

* Docker & Docker Compose
* [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)
* `kubectl`
* `helm`
* `make`

## How to Run the Test

The test is run in two main stages from the root of the repository.

### 1. Start the Backend Services

This command starts Grafana, Tempo, and the other backend services in the background.

```bash
docker-compose -f ./mermin/tests/e2e/grafana/docker-compose.yaml up -d
````

You only need to run this once. The services will continue running until you bring them down.

### 2\. Deploy `mermin` and Run the Test

```bash
# 1. Create the kind cluster
kind create cluster --config examples/local/kind-config.yaml

# 2. Build the mermin image and load it into the cluster
docker build -t mermin:latest --target runner-debug .
kind load docker-image -n atlantis mermin:latest

# 3. (optional) Fetch Helm dependencies
helm repo add netobserv https://elastiflow.github.io/helm-chart-netobserv/
helm repo add opensearch https://opensearch-project.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update
helm dependency build charts/mermin

# 4.
make helm-upgrade EXTRA_HELM_ARGS='--set-file config.source=examples/local/config.hcl'

# 5. (optional) if you already have a Helm release, uninstall it first
helm uninstall mermin
```

This command performs the following steps:

* Deletes any old `kind` cluster named `atlantis`.
* Builds the `mermin:latest` Docker image from your local source code.
* Creates a new `kind` cluster.
* Loads the `mermin:latest` image into the `kind` cluster nodes.
* Deploys the `mermin` Helm chart into the cluster.

### 3. Validate the Results

Once `mermin` is deployed and the `traffic-generator` is running, flow spans should be visible in Grafana.

1. Navigate to the Grafana UI in your browser: **`http://localhost:3000`**.
2. From the side menu, go to the **Explore** view.
3. In the data source dropdown at the top, select **Tempo**.
4. Run a query for the `mermin` service, for example: `{resource.service.name="mermin"}`.
5. **Confirm that `mermin` flow spans are visible in the results.**

### 4. Cleaning Up

To tear down the environments, run the following commands:

```bash
# Stop and remove the Grafana stack containers
docker-compose -f ./mermin/tests/e2e/grafana/docker-compose.yaml down

# Delete the kind cluster
kind delete cluster --name atlantis
```
