# Cursor AI Agent Rules for Mermin Project - Index

**Note: This is an index file. The actual rules are in `mermin-ebpf-guide.mdc` and `docker-commands.mdc` which have `alwaysApply: true`.**

This directory contains guidance files for AI agents working with the Mermin eBPF project in Cursor IDE.

## 📁 Available Guides

### 1. **mermin-ebpf-guide.mdc** (Primary Reference)

The main consolidated guide covering:

- Critical development rules
- eBPF programming patterns
- Debugging and troubleshooting
- Kubernetes deployment
- Common pitfalls and solutions

**Use this as your primary reference for all eBPF development tasks.**

### 2. **docker-commands.mdc**

Quick reference for Docker commands used in development:

- Container setup
- Common cargo operations
- eBPF analysis tools
- Why Docker is required

**Reference this when you need specific command syntax.**

## 🎯 For AI Agents

### When to Apply These Rules

1. **Always apply** when:
   - Working with eBPF code (`mermin-ebpf/` directory)
   - Running cargo commands
   - Using bpftool or llvm-objdump
   - Building or testing the project

2. **Key principles to remember**:
   - ✅ ALWAYS use Docker container for eBPF operations
   - ✅ ALWAYS check bounds before memory access
   - ✅ ALWAYS use bounded loops in eBPF programs
   - ❌ NEVER compile eBPF directly on macOS
   - ❌ NEVER use dynamic allocation in eBPF

### Quick Decision Tree

```
Need to run a command?
├─ Is it eBPF related? → Use Docker container (see docker-commands.mdc)
├─ Writing eBPF code? → Follow patterns in mermin-ebpf-guide.mdc
├─ Debugging issues? → Check troubleshooting in mermin-ebpf-guide.mdc
└─ Deploying to K8s? → See deployment section in mermin-ebpf-guide.mdc
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. First read `mermin-ebpf-guide.mdc` to understand the project
2. Keep `docker-commands.mdc` open for command reference
3. Always test changes in the Docker container
4. Monitor eBPF program complexity and verification status

## 📝 Notes

- These guides are optimized for AI agents in Cursor IDE
- They consolidate best practices from the Mermin project
- Updates should maintain clarity and actionability for AI systems
